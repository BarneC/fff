Fake Function Framework (fff)
-----------------------------

fff is a micro-framework for creating fake C functions for tests.

So whats the point?
 * To make it easy to create fake functions for testing C code.
 * To be simple
 * To work in both C and C++ tests
 
What can it do? 
 * It maintains a call count for each fake function
 * It captures the arguments sent in each function call
 * It captures a call history
 * It is simple - just include a header file and you are good to go.
 
Under the hood:
 * The fff.h header file is generated by a ruby script
 * There are tests under src/test
 * There are examples for testing an embedded UI under src/examples

Still Todo:
 * Function argument history
 * Proper mock - setting expectations, etc
