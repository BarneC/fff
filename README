cmock is a micro-framework for creating fake C functions for tests.

Here are some cmock truths:  
 * It maintains a call count and will capture the arguments sent
 * It can be used in C or C++ tests
 * It is simple - just include a header file and you are good to go.
 
What I'd like to add:
 * Proper mock - setting expectations, etc
